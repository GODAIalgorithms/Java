# Scotland yard project
The project consists of two parts: 1) the implementation of a core game component CW-MODEL in OO-style, 2) the implementation of an open-ended AI extension CW-AI, as well as a 3-page PDF report and a presentation of the work.
Note that the number of rounds in a game is variable positive Integer and is not fixed to 24. Be also aware that when a detective moves, the ticket used will be given to Mr X. In your implementation Mr X should start with the following tickets: Taxi = 4, Bus = 3, Underground = 3, Double = 2, Secret = 5. It is recommended that you pay special attention to rules for double moves and secret moves, since these are particularly complex.
